I‚Äôve been seeing this pop up as I dip my toes into nihilism / philosophy as a whole. 

The hiccup is on meaning, or more specifically using meaning to divine the ‚Äúright‚Äù action. That might not be so clear. I‚Äôll take another stab. This person decided that if life has no meaning, if their actions have no meaning, then there‚Äôs no difference between if they choose coffee (productivity, conformism?) or suicide (death & by an extension the ultimate nothing). As a value judgement, there is perhaps no difference. If we de-load right & wrong, good & evil, etc from our decisions, we have shunned traditional morality. Cool. We can then approach this choice with, hopefully, less contrived baggage. We are no longer hamstrung by the need to declare actions immoral. In my opinion, sweeping & arbitrary designations like this are the language of the oppressor. I should probably take a moment to revisit that loaded statement & explain myself at some point. But not now.

Back to coffee vs. suicide 

There certainly is a difference. Between choosing to drink coffee and choosing to commit suicide. In one scenario you are drinking coffee. In another you are dead. Your death has tangible consequences. You will cease to inhale air, drink water, consume food. You no longer need sustenance. You may fertilize the ground or burn and emit carbon into our failing atmosphere (is that how cremation works?). You will cease to consciously interact with the world around you. You will cease to observe. 

In a world without meaning why do we choose to do things? Because we so please. Life is a sandbox. Being a human is experiential. I breathe, drink, eat, piss, shit, walk, talk, fuck, sleep. There is experiential satisfaction to be found and existential disappointment. I imagine it‚Äôs rooted in how we‚Äôre wired. And how are societies have developed. We have simple imperatives to follow which are quite easily satisfied in 2021. And then plenty of time to ponder, to yearn. We (I) have an affinity for exploration. In a sense, these are easily and incompletely satisfied too. The internet & 21st century entertainment are an unsatisfying outlet for exploration. I can see enough of the world to make it seem mundane. I can see glimpses of other fantasy worlds - ones I wish I could leap to. But I am bound here, in this body. An aging body.

This is so distressing that now suicide doesn‚Äôt sound so bad! I may fantasize over making the ultimate rejection of life - saying fuck this I‚Äôm out! Fuck you god! Fuck you world! But I don‚Äôt really believe in this things anyway. I know this is another product of my human condition. I choose to live and to experience what I may in life. 
Love, joy, beauty. These things are subjective perceptual experiences, yes. But they sure as fuck feel powerfully real, in this body & mind.
Also I sure as hell am curious how it‚Äôll all turn out. My life, this human experiment it‚Äôs set against, the next season of Barry. Plenty to see. 

And maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Maybe there is an afterlife, wether it‚Äôs divinely gifted or man-made. Maybe once we unlock fusion reactors & send rockets to alpha Centauri, or go a year without killing one of our own‚Ä¶ maybe confetti will rain down from the sky, the world will freeze and some voice will announce ‚Äúcongratulations, mission complete. Y‚Äôall won‚Äù 
I‚Äôd be pissed though, that‚Äôs pretty dumb.
